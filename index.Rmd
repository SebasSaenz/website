## Welcome!!


Hi my name is **Johan Sebastián Sáenz** and I am a microbial ecologist currently
working in the [Department of Functional Microbiology of Livestock](https://livestock-functional-microbiology.uni-hohenheim.de/en) 
at the Hohenheim University.

I am interested in the main drivers of microbial community structure and function,
with special focus on the phage´s role.



This is my personal site please look around and contact me!!
